        My name is Paige W. Shaw, and I am an entrepreneur. I grew up in Whitefish, Montana, where 
        I always had the opprotunity to appreciate the diverse sounds of nature around me. As a teenager, 
        I would always take the time to admire my surroundings whenever I was outside. I loved the gentle
        of the creek in my backyard and the varying sounds of birds every morning. Therefore, I created
        this website so that everyone could enjoy the symphony of nature, no matter where they are.
