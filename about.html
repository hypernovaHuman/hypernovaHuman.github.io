        My name is Paige W. Shaw, and I am an entrepreneur. I grew up in Whitefish, Montana, where 
        I always had the opprotunity to appreciate the diverse sounds of nature around me. As a teenager, 
        I would always take the time to admire my surroundings whenever I was outside. I loved the gentle
        of the creek in my backyard and the varying sounds of birds every morning. They served as a
        sustaiable stress reliever and a way to better maintain my personal, emotional, and mental wellbeing.
        Therefore, I created this website so that everyone could enjoy the symphony of nature, no matter
        where they are to enjoy the benefits brough by listening to the therapedic sounds of nature. I also
        sell healing crystals, which clearly benefit the user's spiritual health. Please use any of the
        contact resources below if you have any questions regarding my website or if you want to order my
        premium healing crystals.
